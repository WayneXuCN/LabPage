I focus on addressing the complex and dynamic risks faced by urban critical infrastructure, particularly when multiple risk factors interact. These risks stem from natural events, like extreme weather, and human actions, such as network failures or accidents. As urban infrastructures become more interdependent, my research aims to develop a robust framework for assessing and mitigating these risks, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches and data-driven techniques to enhance resilience.

My key objectives are:

- Risk Feature Perception: Integrating multi-source data to identify key risk elements and their interdependencies, with a focus on understanding how risks evolve and interact over time and across regions.

- Composite Risk Measurement: Developing models to integrate various risk elements—probabilities, consequences, and knowledge—to provide a comprehensive and accurate risk assessment.

- Panoramic Risk Governance: Creating strategies for managing complex risks through a governance framework that integrates historical, current, and future data, supporting proactive and effective decision-making.
