I focus on addressing the complex and dynamic risks faced by urban critical infrastructure, particularly when multiple risk factors interact. These risks stem from natural events, like extreme weather, and human actions, such as network failures or accidents. As urban infrastructures become more interdependent, my research aims to develop a robust framework for assessing and mitigating these risks, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches and data-driven techniques to enhance resilience.
