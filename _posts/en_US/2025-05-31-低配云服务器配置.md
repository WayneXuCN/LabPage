## Server Configuration Overview

Recently, I purchased a cheap Alibaba Cloud ECS server with the following specs:

- **CPU**: 2 cores (vCPU)
- **Memory**: 2 GiB
- **Storage**: Cloud disk 40 GiB (2120 IOPS)
- **Network**: Fixed bandwidth 3M

The configuration is very basic. This post documents various issues encountered during use and their solutions.

## Configuration Optimization

### pnpm Optimization

Due to memory and CPU limitations, pnpm may freeze when installing dependencies. It's necessary to limit concurrency and retry parameters:

```bash
# Limit concurrency to avoid running out of memory
pnpm config set concurrency 2

# Disable pnpm's automatic lockfile updates to reduce disk IO during install
pnpm config set auto-install-peers=false

# Set retry count to improve success rate in unstable networks
pnpm config set fetch-retries 3

# Set retry factor to increase the interval between retries
pnpm config set fetch-retry-factor 2

# Set network timeout
pnpm config set network-timeout 60000
```
