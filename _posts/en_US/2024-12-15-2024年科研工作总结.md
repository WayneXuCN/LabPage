I started my research journey in 2020, when the concept of "scientific research" was still unfamiliar to me. By 2023, I had entered graduate school and applied for a direct PhD transfer at the end of 2024. Looking back over these four years, the process was not always smooth, but I did not encounter any insurmountable difficulties. The period from 2023 to 2024 was both a new starting point (beginning my graduate studies) and a stage full of contradictions for me—it was both my most diligent and my most idle year. I say diligent because I devoted considerable time to learning new skills, methods, and ideas; idle because I almost completely gave up exercising, lost interest in writing papers, and spent about half my time playing games (Auto Chess) or tinkering with various gadgets (I love coding), with my focus not really on research work, resulting in a lot of wasted time. Nevertheless, this year was not without gains. My main achievements can be summarized as follows:

- Published four Chinese papers (three were project-commissioned reports, each several thousand words, and the other was previous work published in a CSSCI journal); and one English paper (EI indexed, conference submission);
- Applied for two software copyrights (mainly to meet the requirements for my supervisor's National Natural Science Foundation project completion, so I quickly finished two);
- Received two academic awards (both "Best Paper" at conferences, one of which was recognized as an important conference by the Strategic Institute, though the overall level was low);
- Participated as a key researcher in six or seven research projects (although these tasks were not technically challenging, they improved my ability to handle different types of academic writing. However, after each task, I would experience a period of "paper fatigue");
- Helped a fellow student revise a Chinese C-journal paper at my supervisor's request (helping others revise is even more exhausting than writing my own, but I got second authorship as a result);
- Submitted a long-delayed English paper (this paper integrated two projects, one of which was my colleague's work that I was not familiar with, so I lacked motivation during the writing process; after several rejections, I reorganized and resubmitted it at the end of the year);
- One ongoing project (the scope is too ambitious, progress is slow, mainly due to my own laziness).
