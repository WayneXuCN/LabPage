> Most configuration methods for macOS are similar to Linux. This post only records macOS-specific configurations, issues, and some commonly used tools.

## System Configuration

### 1. Initial Setup

- Enable installation of apps from any source: `sudo spctl --master-disable`
- Install software to an external hard drive

  ```bash
  # Create an Applications directory on the external drive
  mkdir /Volumes/Work/Application
  # Create Library and Application Support directories on the external drive
  mkdir -p /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support
  # Move the app folder from /Applications to the external Applications directory (manually or via command)
  mv /Applications/A.app /Volumes/Work/Application
  # Go to the system Applications directory
  cd /Applications
  # Link the app back to the internal drive
  ln -s /Volumes/Work/Application/A.app ./A.app
  # If the app has files in ~/Library/Application Support, move them to the external drive
  mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/A /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support
  # And create a symlink
  ln -s /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support/A ~/Library/Application\ Support
  ```

- Remove unnecessary login items and extensions

  ```bash
  # Open the following folders in Finder and delete files matching the login item names
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  /Library/LaunchAgents
  /Library/LaunchDaemons
  ```

### 2. Unlimited Trial for Eudic Dictionary

The Mac version of Eudic Dictionary differs from the Windows version. The Mac version limits trial usage if not registered. You can bypass this by modifying local preferences as follows:

- Open Finder
- Shortcut: `Cmd + Shift + G`
- Enter path: `~/Library/Preferences`
- Find the file: `com.eusoft.eudic.plist`
- Open the binary plist file as XML (you can use the Binary Plist extension in VSCode)
- Locate the field: `MAIN_TimesLeft`
- Change its value to a large number (e.g., 99999) and save

Reopen Eudic Dictionary to use pro features unlimited times. This persists even after upgrades.

## Development Configuration

### 1. Python (conda-forge)

#### numpy

- NumPy is optimized via Apple's Accelerate framework (BLAS). When using conda, you need to specify `numpy`'s BLAS dependency. If installing via PyPI Wheel, `numpy>2.0` will automatically use Accelerate BLAS.

  ```bash
  conda install numpy "blas=*=*accelerate*"
  ```

- You can also switch the BLAS implementation for the environment. This command only affects the BLAS library itself and does not automatically install other packages that depend on BLAS. If other packages require BLAS, you need to install them manually.

  ```bash
  conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate" # new command
  conda install "blas=*=accelerate" # old command
  ```

- To pin a specific BLAS implementation and prevent conda from rolling back, add `libblas=*=*accelerate` to `<conda-root>/envs/<env-name>/conda-meta/pinned` as described in the conda docs.
