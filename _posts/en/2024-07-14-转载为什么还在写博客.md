Spencer Fry wrote an excellent article on "Why Entrepreneurs Should Write." I'd like to add that the benefits of writing go far beyond what you might expect—even if you have no readers (regardless of whether you're an entrepreneur), it's still worth having a blog.

I currently have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some are just random ideas I jotted down, recording my process of self-debate. Most of these drafts may never be published, but each piece of writing has brought me unique value.

### Writing Makes You a Better Reader

Blogging has changed the way I read other people's work.

In the process of searching for suitable structures and ways to express myself, I've become more sensitive to what makes a good argument and what makes a weak one. I've also become better at spotting flaws in others' reasoning.

At the same time, when reading, I'm no longer easily misled by weak counterexamples that superficially refute an article. Almost every article has some counterexamples, often based on specific exceptions. Online commenters love to point these out. However, these exceptions often miss the main point of the article. By understanding the implicit context behind a piece, I get much more value from reading.

I also pay more attention to the writing styles of great authors. I mentally note how good writers express their ideas. I've always enjoyed Paul Graham's essays, but now I appreciate even more how he organizes his articles. He has a mesmerizing ability to draw readers into his world and get them to see things from his perspective. I've also learned a lot of good writing techniques from reading Bradford Cross's blog; his articles are well-structured, and the short paragraphs make them very easy to read.

### Writing Makes You Smarter

Writing exposes the gaps in your thinking. When you put your ideas down and look back at them, they're far less convincing than they seemed in your head. Writing forces you to mature your arguments by thinking through possible objections.

Writing helps you organize your thoughts more coherently. This makes you a better conversationalist on related topics. I can't count how many times I've had deeper conversations with others simply because I'd already organized my thoughts through writing.

### Everything Else Is Just a Bonus

Other benefits of writing—personal branding, networking, more opportunities—are just bonuses. While these can be significant, they're not the main reason you should write.

You should write because writing makes you a better person.
